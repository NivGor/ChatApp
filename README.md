Active branch: after_webAPI_2

Welcome to Niv and Or's project. To use the app you may register as a new account or log in as an existing account from the following: {username: mojo, passwrd: 123456a}, {username: joe mama, passwrd: 123456a}.

if you want to add a contact, make sure that the user is registered, and make sure to use localhost:5026 as the server.

to run the web api and the review pages you will have to run both projects in paralel, otherwise, you can test it one by one (you can enter the review page through the login screen, which doesn't require the web api to run) *** make sure that the review page runs on localhost:5042 and that the web api runs on localhost:5026 ***

The web api and the review page are in the same folder but the react application is in the ap2 folder. please download the latest branch (after_webAPI_2)
